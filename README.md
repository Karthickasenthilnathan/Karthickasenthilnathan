ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Karthicka â€” a Computer Science Engineering student specializing in Cybersecurity with a strong curiosity for how technology shapes the world.

Right now, Iâ€™m getting my hands dirty with Web Development, UI/UX Design, AI & ML, and Cybersecurity â€” experimenting, breaking things, and rebuilding them to learn better. My GitHub is the space where I document this journey, from small starter projects to ideas Iâ€™m slowly shaping into impactful solutions.
