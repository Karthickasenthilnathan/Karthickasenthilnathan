## 💡 My Story (Very Short)  
I discovered coding during my first year of engineering — started with Java, then JS/React for web, and Python opened my eyes to AI & ML.  
Now I’m exploring web security, sharpening problem-solving and diving deep into cybersecurity and automation.  

When I’m not coding, I try to blend tech + social impact — from volunteering for village wellness & career-guidance programs to dreaming of building tools that matter.
